#_Simon Memory Game_

Simon is a memory game originally launched in 1978 by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison<sup>1(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)>)</sup>.
This game creates a series of tones and lights and requires the user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. There is no time limit involved in this version of Simon. However this version of the game features a "Strict Mode" where errors are not allowed.
